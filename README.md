When assigning credit scores to loan applicants, one common challenge is that bankers may distrust machine learning models, finding them opaque and unreliable. To tackle concerns about transparency in assessing creditworthiness, this project incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance the interpretability of these models.

Additionally, since bank loan datasets are often highly imbalanced, with more applications deemed not creditworthy, I applied the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data. This approach improves the evaluation metrics of the models and ensures fairness by reducing bias toward both creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants.
